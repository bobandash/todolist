# todolist

This project was a To-Do List written in vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML for The Odin Project.
Below is the URL for the To-Do List:

I finished the bulk of the To-Do List; however, there are still some missing features I may add in the future:
Features:
- Filter By Today
- Filter By This Week
- Ability to Delete Projects
- Local Storage / Google Sign-in API to store tasks/subtasks
- Ability to move subtasks or tasks around through drag and drop
- Submit form by pressing enter key rather than click
- Specific changes to the UI of the site
    - Sidebar does not look good on desktop
    - If both Estimated Time For Completion and Due Date are added, the site looks chonky
- When on hover for some divs, there are no pointers

Notable Bugs
- JS Date Picker gives error that it was already created when another popover element is clicked on, and then the due date icon is clicked on

Reflection:
First and foremost, I thought this project took way too long on my end. I had some real life commitments to deal with, but I realized through this project and coding in general, I only start to make progress if I'm in a flow state. It's not possible for me to work on the project for 30 minutes to an hour and come back to it a few days or a week after, and work for 30 minutes to an hour again. I have to set an uninterrupted long block of time to do the project. It's been difficult to make time the past few months, but now that it's 2023, new year new me! Just kidding, but for the next project, I'm definitely making a schedule and setting a deadline.

Things are created twice - first at the ideation stage and second when actually building the project. In the ideation stage, I don't have to have all the code written, but I want to at least have an initial idea of how to implement everything. That way, there's still some surprises but not a lot of big suprises.

HTML helper functions - I wasted a lot time rewriting my HTML into dynamic JS. For vanilla JS, if I'm creating a dynamic website, I should define helper HTML functions from the get-go.

I should use ids and classes for styling, and data attributes for js selectors. Speaking of my html and css, it's extremely messy. Of course, I'm going to learn linting in the future, but the html/css were so messy that, when I came back to the project, I got confused and re-read my code.

SOLID principles - In regards to my code, I nested a lot of functions inside other functions. I still don't know whether or not that's standard practice but I became really confused about the organization of my code as I continued with the project. Before I start my next project, I'll search up other ways to organize code so I have more tools in my arsenal.

I definitely have a lot more to improve on, and I'll take everything step-by-step.
